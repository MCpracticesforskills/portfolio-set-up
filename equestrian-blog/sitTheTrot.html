      <h2 class="pt-5">Steps</h2>
      <p>
        Make sure you have mastered the posting trot before attempting to sit
        the trot
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Establish an uphill, energetic walk</li>
        <li>
          Establish a thorough contact so the bit connects with the horse's
          mouth, but not too tightly
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain good posture. Hips should be loose. Look where you want to go
        </li>
        <li>
          Engage your core to ready yourself for the trot transition. Don't lean
          forward
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you are ready to trot, squeeze both legs on the horse's sides at
          the girth
        </li>
        <li>Once the horse stars trotting, stop squeezing your legs</li>
        <li>
          Allow the up-beat energy of the horse's back pass through your body
        </li>
        <li>Continue to engage your core and allow your hips to relax</li>
        <li>Go with the motion of the horse's trot, not against it</li>
        <li>
          If the horse goes too fast, sit heavier in the saddle to tell it to
          slow down
        </li>
        <li>
          If the horse goes too slow, tap its side with your legs. Don't clamp
          your legs on the horse
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue to trot at your own pace. You may transition up or down from
          here
        </li>
      </ol>

            <p>
              Relaxation in the body is key. If your body is supple, especially
              your hips, then you will move more freely with the horse.
            </p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h4>Tense</h4>
            <img
              src="/imagez/cone.png"
              alt="red traffic cone"
              width="150"
              class="pb-3"
            />
            <p>
              If your muscles are tense, then you are going to bounce in the
              trot. The bouncing motion will irritate the horse. Tension is a
              mistake most beginners make because they are told to “hold a tight
              core”. While this is true, you must not be too tight. If you are
              too tight your position will hinder the horse's natural movement.
              Tension can also cause you to lean forward, lose balance, or fall
              off.

          <div class="col-6">
            <h4>Create a collected trot</h4>
            <img

            />
            <p>
              To sit the trot, you must create a trot that is capable of being
              sat. Establishing a collected trot ensures the horse is lifting
              through its back and thus the motion of the trot is much easier to
              sit. <br />
              When the horse is collected, it is engaging all the proper
              muscles, so it builds the right kind of fitness.
            </p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h4>Create an uncollected trot</h4>
            <img
              src="/imagez/hollow-back.webp"
              alt="hollow back versus correct back"
              width="200"
              class="pb-3"
            />
            <p>
              If your horse is trotting with a hollow back, then the motion of
              the trot will be difficult to sit. A hollow back might lead to
              injury as the horse is not using its muscles properly.

            <p>
              Think of letting your body become one with the horse’s body. Relax
              your seat & legs. Let your legs hang in an elongated manner. Point
              your toes up. The fleshy part of your inner thigh should carry
              most of the weight.
            </p>

                bent. That is how you want to look while sitting on the horse.
                If the horse were to suddenly disappear from beneath you, you’d
                want to be able to land on the ground without falling.</em

            <p>
              Bouncing on the horse's back is irritating to the horse and
              equally uncomfortable for you. If you start bouncing, post the
              trot until you can create a collected trot. Maintain posting trot
              for ~5 strides then try sitting again. Repeat as needed.

                You can also try transitioning to walk for ~5 strides, but don’t
                create a downhill energy in the trot transition.
