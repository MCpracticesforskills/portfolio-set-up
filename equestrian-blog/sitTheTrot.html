        <em>Demystify the sitting trot with these steps... </em>
      </p>
      <h2 class="pt-5">Steps</h2>
      <p>
        Make sure you have mastered the posting trot before attempting to sit
        the trot
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Establish an uphill, energetic walk</li>
        <li>
          Establish a thorough contact so the bit connects with the horse's
          mouth, but not too tightly
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain good posture. Hips should be loose. Look where you want to go
        </li>
        <li>
          Engage your core to ready yourself for the trot transition. Don't lean
          forward
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you are ready to trot, squeeze both legs on the horse's sides at
          the girth
        </li>
        <li>Once the horse stars trotting, stop squeezing your legs</li>
        <li>
          Allow the up-beat energy of the horse's back pass through your body
        </li>
        <li>Continue to engage your core and allow your hips to relax</li>
        <li>Go with the motion of the horse's trot, not against it</li>
        <li>
          If the horse goes too fast, sit heavier in the saddle to tell it to
          slow down
        </li>
        <li>
          If the horse goes too slow, tap its side with your legs. Don't clamp
          your legs on the horse
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue to trot at your own pace. You may transition up or down from
          here
        </li>
      </ol>

            <p>
              Relaxation in the body is key. If your body is supple, especially
              your hips, then you will move more freely with the horse.
            </p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h4 class="p-3">Tense</h4>

              class="pb-3"
            />
            <p>
              If your muscles are tense, then you are going to bounce in the
              trot. The bouncing motion will irritate the horse. Tension is a
              mistake most beginners make because they are told to “hold a tight
              core”. While this is true, you must not be too tight. If you are
              too tight your position will hinder the horse's natural movement.
              Tension can also cause you to lean forward, lose balance, or fall
              off.
            </p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h4 class="p-3">Create a collected trot</h4>

            />
            <p>
              To sit the trot, you must create a trot that is capable of being
              sat. Establishing a collected trot ensures the horse is lifting
              through its back and thus the motion of the trot is much easier to
              sit. <br />
              When the horse is collected, it is engaging all the proper
              muscles, so it builds the right kind of fitness.

            <p>
              If the horse is trotting with a hollow back, then the motion of
              the trot will be difficult to sit. A hollow back might lead to
              injury as the horse is not using its muscles properly.

            <p>
              Think of letting your body become one with the horse’s body. Relax
              your seat & legs. Let your legs hang in an elongated manner. Point
              your toes up. The fleshy part of your inner thigh should carry
              most of the weight.

                want to be able to land on the ground without falling.</em

              Bouncing on the horse's back is irritating to the horse and
              equally uncomfortable for you. If you start bouncing, post the
              trot until you can create a collected trot. Maintain posting trot
              for ~5 strides then try sitting again. Repeat as needed.

            <p>There could be a few issues…</p>
            <h5>Potential Issue #1: Incorrect Aids</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Ask with both legs</li>
              <li>
                Make sure you are not pulling on the reigns too hard. If you
                pull back on the reigns during the transition, then the horse
                will be confused (and possibly uncomfortable) and won’t want to
                trot.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure you are not pulling unevenly on the reigns. If you
                pull sharply on the left reign, the the horse will be forced to
                throw its shoulders to the right. Once the shoulders are out of
                alignment, the horse cannot pick up the trot transition.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Potential Issue #2: Horse Ignores Rider's Aids</h5>

            <ul>
              <li>
                If the horse ignores your aids, then give the horse a warning
                before escalating to a sharper aid.
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, ask for trot by squeezing both legs, if the horse
                doesn’t trot then kick with your legs. If the horse ignores the
                kick then tap the hindquarters with a whip. If the horse ignores
                the whip, then ask a person/friend/trainer to crack a lunge whip
                while you ride, so the sound of the whip encourages the horse to
                trot exactly when you ask the horse to trot.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Cracking a lunge whip method is especially helpful for horses
                  who need more forward encouragement without harming the horse.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Correct the horse the instant it refuses/ignores your aids. If
                you wait too long to correct the behavior, then the horse will
                be confused as to what you are asking.
              </li>
              <p class="tip">
                You must train horses with clear communication, so they can
                easily understand. Remember, they cannot speak human language;
                they only speak horse language. Use their language to
                communicate with them.

          <div class="col-6">
            <p>There could be a few issues...</p>
            <h5>Potential Issue #1: Collection</h5>
            <img
              src="/imagez/uncollectedB.png"
              width="500"
              alt="horse uncollected versus horse collected"
              title="horse graphic"
            />
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the horse trots uncollected (i.e with a hollow back), then
                the motion is going to be difficult to sit. Horses can trot fast
                as long as they are also collected, so the real issue is the
                horse needs to collect. (Speed is often not the issue)
              </li>
              <li>
                In order to get the horse collected, make sure you are pushing
                the horse into the reign contact and they are actively searching
                and accepting the reign contact.
              </li>
              <li>Try these exercises to get the horse more collected:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Walk or trot a 20 meter circle and place their haunches to the
                  inside of the circle. Repeat on the other side.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Walk or trot a serpentine to get the horse loosened up and
                  ready to accept reign contact and lift its back. Repeat on the
                  other side.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Walk or trot down the long side of the dressage court (or just
                  walk or trot a straight line) and tell the horse to move their
                  haunches in. Repeat on the other side.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Walk into a turn. In the turn, tell the horse to shoulder in.
                  When the horse’s inside hind leg steps underneath its body,
                  ask for the trot
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="tip">
              When the horse’s inside hind steps underneath its body, it will be
              ready for any transition. The amount of bend in the horse’s body
              will encourage the horse to lift its back for a more collected
              trot. Always repeat on the other side, so the horse develops
              muscles evenly.
            </p>
            <h5>Potential Issue #2: Nervous Horse</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When horses get nervous, they enter <em>flight response</em>
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Flight response makes the horse want to run</li>
                <li>
                  If your horse is in flight response, find the quickest way to
                  get them calm. Try the <strong>relax reign</strong> circle
                  excecise:
                </li>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    When the horse speeds up, turn the horse in a tight circle
                  </li>
                  <li>While in the tight circle, disengage the hindquarters</li>
                  <li>
                    Keep disengaging the hindquarters until the horse relaxes
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Only release the horse from the tight circle when they relax
                  </li>
                  <li>Repeat if neccessary</li>
                </ol>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="tip">
              The relax reign exercise helps the horse exit
              <em>flight response</em>. The bending motion of the circle
              combined with the disengagment of the horse's hindquarters
              promotes a physiological calm response similar to swaddling a baby
              with a towel. The circular motion lulls the horse while activating
              the thinking part of their brain as opposed to the flight part of
              their brain.

            <h5>Potential Issue #3: Horse Doesn't Understand</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sometimes riders don't know the horse's background & previouse
                experiences
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Horses might not understand the trot yet.</li>
                <li>
                  It is the rider's responsibility to ensure the horse
                  understand all aids and cues before asking the horse to trot
                  (or do any other activity)
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If you suspect the horse doesn't understand the trot, then
                    don't push them harder
                  </li>
                  <li>Instead, opt for taking a step back</li>
                  <li>Make sure they understand simpler concepts like:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Moving away from <strong>driving pressure</strong></li>
                    <li>Accepting <strong>steady pressure</strong></li>
                    <li>Respecting the rider's space</li>
                    <li>Accepting a rider on their back</li>
                    <li>Walking, stopping, turning, different yeilds, etc.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    If the horse still doesn't understand, then consult with a
                    trainer: the horse might be missing crucial pieces of its
                    foundational learning
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </ul>

              This is a rider issue. Here are some things the rider can do to
              not bounce:
            </p>
            <h4>Solution #1: Take Lessons with a Trainer</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Find a reputatble trainer</li>
              <li>
                Tell the trainer that you struggle with bouncing in the trot.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The trainer can give you exercises to do in and out of the
                    saddle to help you maintain your balance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They might even put you on a lesson horse who can help you
                    sit the trot.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                The trainer might give you a lesson on a lunge line, so you can
                focus on feel & body position.

                />
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Solution #2: Stretch Before You Ride</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Stretch your legs and entire body before you get in the saddle.
              </li>
              <li>
                If your body is supple and able to go with the motion of the
                horse, then the horse will have a much easier time carrying you.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do these stretches on both sides:</p>

              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Solution #3: Neutral Spine</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Keep your spine neutral, so your spine aligns with the horse's
                spine. This posture is effective for sitting the trot.

                  Visual: Think about trying to balance a bowl of water without
                  spilling. If your pelvis is unbalanced, then you will spill
                  the water.
